For model selection, I had 3 options, OLSR, Ridge, and Lasso
I divided the model randomly in test and cross-validation data set in 70 - 30 ratio
Then I trained all 3 models with varying degree of parameters ranging from 1 to 4 (both inclusive)
For Ridge and Lasso, I trained them with varying degree of alpha ranging from 0.0001 to 10
To select the best model, I chose the one with highest cross validation accuracy

eval.py trains the Ridge with degree 2 and alpha 0.01 (found best while training)
and asks for the test data file Name
it prints the training accuracy, test accuracy, correlation coefficient of prediction from previous model, and correlation coefficient of previous prediction
